Porting of the Kodi plugin to xbmc4xbox



â€¢To do list:

Live radio (out of memory, works if you first download and run the m3u8 file )

Live TV (out of memory, need to understand how it works)

Fix some on demand programs not playing (the m3u8 file works, but on the Xbox it searches for a different link, need to look at it)
